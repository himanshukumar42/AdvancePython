# Advanced Python Concepts Learning Project

This project is a comprehensive collection of resources and implementations focused on advanced Python concepts, design patterns, system design, and problem-solving techniques. The objective is to deepen understanding and enhance skills in these areas through practical coding exercises and examples. By working through this project, I aim to solidify my knowledge and become proficient in implementing these concepts in real-world applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each focusing on a specific topic:



## Topics Covered

### 1. Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming is a paradigm that allows for concurrent execution of code. This section covers:

- **Understanding `async` and `await`**: Basics of defining asynchronous functions and how to await their results.
- **Implementing Asynchronous Functions**: Handling I/O-bound tasks for non-blocking code.
- **Concurrency Management**: Differences between concurrency and parallelism, and effective task management using Python's `asyncio` library.

### 2. Design Patterns
Design patterns provide proven solutions to common software design problems. This section is divided into several subcategories:

- **Creational Patterns**: Focus on object creation mechanisms.
- **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Concentrate on communication between objects.

### 3. Problem Solving
This section includes solutions to various algorithmic problems commonly asked in technical interviews, focusing on practical implementations:

- **Data Structures**: Custom implementations of data structures like sets, tuples, and dictionaries.
- **Algorithm Challenges**: Solutions to LeetCode problems and other coding challenges that enhance problem-solving skills.

### 4. SOLID Principles
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.

### 5. Dataclasses and Metaclasses
- **Dataclasses**: Introduced in Python 3.7, dataclasses provide a decorator and functions for automatically adding special methods to classes. This section explores their use in simplifying class definitions and enhancing readability.

- **Metaclasses**: Advanced Python concepts that allow for class customization. This section includes examples of metaclasses for enforcing rules on class creation and behavior.
